# LoRaWanSoFa
This is the repository of a university project at the Fontys Hogeschool Techniek en Logistiek. As a software factory, a team of student is working together as a team to create a product for a customer. The project that will be created within the software factory is a semi-private LoRaWan network that will connect a private network of our customer with the community network of TheThingsNetwork(https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/).

Most of the code uploaded to the repository will be go code that will create the semi private LoRaWan network. This is uploaded here to be used by members of the TTN community to create their own semi-private networks.
